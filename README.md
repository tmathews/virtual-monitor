This is a very simple UWP application for monitoring video & audio input. The most common case for this application is
to view a console or a piece of camera equipment.

## Notes

Open to improvements, but I mainly use this to play my Switch on my computer and have done everything I need. This being
said I probably won't be add any new features unless I find something to improve for myself.
